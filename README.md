# Instagram-User-Analytics

In this project, I was using SQL and MySQL Workbench as your tool to analyze Instagram user data and answer questions posed by the management team. My insights will help the product manager and the rest of the team make informed decisions about the future direction of the Instagram app.
Remember, the goal of this project is to use my SQL skills to extract meaningful insights from the data. My findings could potentially influence the future development of one of the world's most popular social media platforms.
